                    <p>You are most welcome to come and assist at Mass. Be advised that we do enforce a dress code while on church property<br><br>
                        According to Apostolic Tradition and out of respect for our Lord's presence in the Most Blessed Sacrament, the faithful 
                        must dress modestly while in the church and assisting at Holy Mass. Hence, please observe the following rules:<br><br>Women and 
                        girls must wear a modest dress and cover their heads with either a hat or chapel veil. Short skirts or dresses that are 
                        above the knees, revealing blouses (such as low cut, sleeveless or see-through), slacks or shorts of any length do not 
                        meet the norms of Christian modesty.<br><br>Men and boys should be wearing neat trousers, a coat, jacket or a dress sweater
                        and tie. Jeans, shorts, open shirts, sneakers and other such casual dress are inappropriate and do not meet the standards 
                        for Mass.<br><br>Please be advised that the priest reserves the right to refuse Holy Communion to anyone, who in his prudent judgment,
                        does not meet the requirements of the Rules for Receiving Holy Communion and Dress Code as stated above.</p>
